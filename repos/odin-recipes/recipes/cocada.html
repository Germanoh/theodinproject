        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Brazilian sweet made from coconut and sweetened condensed milk, can be served by itself or used in hot beverages like coffee<br />
            to act as a sweetener.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>&#189; can sugar (use sweetened condensed milk can as measure)</li>
            <li>3 cups grated fresh coconut</li>
            <li>&#189; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Step 1<br />
                    Combine condensed milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract in a large saucepan.<br />
                    Heat over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens<br />
                    and becomes a little darker. If you find that the cocada is cooking too quickly, reduce heat<br /> 
                    to low and continue stirring.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Step 2<br />
                    Once the mixture has thickened enough and feels heavy on the spoon, remove from<br />
                    heat and place spoonfuls on a piece of parchment paper.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Step 3<br />
                    Let cool for about 30 minutes (cocada will harden a bit) and transfer to a sealed<br /> 
                    container.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
